## Recuitment Excercise 

Submitted by Kevin Mirafuentes

Notes:

- For authentication, I added a custom guard that validates the user session, see App/Services/NetzweltGuard 
- Main logic for api calls are added on App/Services/ApiService
- See App\Http\Controllers\ShowDashboard for the main output controller
- Test user: foo / bar
